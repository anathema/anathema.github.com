## Quickstart Guide

### Installation
Regular releases are pre-packed and installed on their own. Auto-installing packages for different operating systems are available.
If you downloaded the raw (.zip) package, the archive can simply be extracted into the target directory.
If the recommended download is not to your liking, please select one from our <a href="anathema.butatopanto.de:8081/full">archives</a>.

### Launch
Depending on your download choice and operating system, you are provided with a executable file or link for launching Anathema.
If yours was the raw download, chances are your system allows to launch Anathema by double-clicking "anathema.jar" in the main folder.
Failing that, you will need to open a console window, switch to the installation directory and type "java -jar anathema.jar".

### Enjoy Anathema!
