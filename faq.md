## Technicalities

### I cannot run Anathema on Windows Vista.

On certain configurations of Windows Vista, Anathema won't be able to create a repository folder.  
Please use our Windows installer so all necessary permissions are granted.

### What hardware/software do I need to run Anathema?

Anathema will run on any operating system with [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.java.com) Version 6 or later.

### Java is installed, but Anathema still won't run.

First, ensure that you've extracted all ZIPped files to their full pathnames.  
If errors persist, please ascertain that you have the latest release.  
Should all that fail, please contact us with the following information:

* Which version of Java are you using?
* What is your operating system?
* Which release of Anathema causes the error?
* What command or action do you use to launch Anathema?

### Are there further instructions?

We have a quickstart guide on the [Downloads](/downloads) page and a more [complete guide](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/wiki/Guide) in our wiki.
