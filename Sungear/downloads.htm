<h2>Quickstart Guide</h2>

	requirements to ensure optimal performance.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		Anathema is	written in Java and will run on any system with a compatible Java
		Virtual Machine, that includes Windows, Linux AND Macintosh.
		Make sure that you have the <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java Runtime Environment</a> Version 5.0
		installed on your system

	<h3>Download</h3>
	<p>
	Download the latest files for Anathema from the
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=122320">SourceForge download system</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	The newest files are always conveniently listed at the top. Simply download all neccessary files
	with the word "user" in their name. These files come in two versions, each with a slightly
	different installation procedure.
	</p>
	<blockquote><b>Full Releases</b>, indicated by some Exalted-related name. These releases are installations that stand alone.</blockquote>
	<blockquote><b>Patches</b>, clearly designated by the word "patch" in the file name. These fix and improve minor issues in already installed releases.</blockquote>

	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<p>
	Full Releases are pre-packed and installed on their own. There are different variations avilable for different
	operating systems. Depending on the package downloaded, the archive can either simply be extracted into the target
	directory, or the supplied installation script (some operating systems only) can be executed to easily and properly 
	install Anathema.</p>
	<P>
	Patches, on the other hand, need to be properly applied to an existing installation to work. In the case of archives,
	they have to be extracted over an existing installation of the corresponding regular release to work properly. Some
	patches can also come as self-extracting installers that work almost automatically.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	Note also that Anathema is not yet feature complete and that all packages should only be considered preview releases.
	</blockquote>


<h2>Sourcecode Downloads</h2>

	<p>
	Each Full Release is also available as a "developer" archive, a simple package that	contains everything 
	in the user package together with the program source code. We will also offer this service for Patches
	archives whenever possible. Just like the "user" installations, these files can be found on the
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=122320">SourceForge download system</a>.

	In addition to the "developer" packages, the latest development code is also available online directly
	from our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=122320">SourceForge SVN server</a> at all times.
