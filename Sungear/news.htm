<p><b>posted by Urs on 22/10/2006</b></p>
<p>After two years of work, toils, sweat, tears and equal amounts of thinking, we are proud to present the first feature complete version of Anathema. Wait, didn't we have this opener once before?</p>

<p>Old text, new features: New, among others, are the great new icons and support for Equipment, Crafts and Languages.</p>

<p>Anyway, you probably know the deal: <a href="?page=downloads">Download</a> away and enjoy.</p>

<h2>New website unveiled</h2>
<p><b>posted by Urs on 05/09/2006</b></p>
<p>After three month of discussion, labor, more discussion and equal amounts of refinement, we are proud to present the new Anathema website. Crafted by Martin Nerukar, known to the net as Democritus, it marks the first step towards a new, more mature look of the entire project.</p>

<p>If you asked Martin where to go from here, he'd recommend the <a href="?page=features">features</a> page, there to marvel at the brand new screenshots. I, on the other hand, would point you to <a href="?page=development">development</a>. Go there if you want to know what <i>else</i> is hot.</p>

<p>No matter your decision, we hope you enjoy your stay and, as always, Anathema.<br/></p>
