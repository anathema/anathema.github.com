<h2>What's that? (Updated)</h2>

<p>A surveillance camera? No! It's a release! With new character templates, even (Kudos to Thraxis)!</br>
I finally made it and fixed that last bug that was nagging me, and uploaded the thing as well.</p>
<p>It's Lookshyans only, with neither Lunars nor Sidereals, but it might still be worth a <a href="?page=downloads">download</a>.</p> 
<p><b>Update:</b>There was a problem in yesterdays release that made all Charms unlearnable. If you already downloaded, I must humbly ask that you do so again. Please excuse the inconvenience.</p>

<h2>Bring me your bugs</h2>

<p>Thanks to the kind people at FogCreek Software, Anathema finally has a decent issue tracking system.</br>
From now on, please submit your bugs and feature requests to <a href="http://anathema.fogbugz.com">FogBugz</a>.
I hope you'll find the system as easy to use as I do.</p>
<p>(Note that this ends our lock on feature requests - we probably won't do anything about them just yet, but knowing
about your needs won't do us any harm.)</p>

<p>Sung to the tune of the Beatles, obviously. Third anniversary. New release as well. Includes stuff by third parties. Which might be removed later.
Must find a way to come up with 5 newsposts in advance. Out. Urs.
<p>Lest I forget: Here's your <a href="?page=downloads">download</a>.<p>
