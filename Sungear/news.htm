<h2>Fixing...</h2>
<p><b>posted by Urs on 11/02/2007</b></p>
<p>At long last, I am proud to present the new version of Anathema, featuring absolutely no "one big thing".
Instead, there's a plethora of updates and fixes and niceties for you to enjoy, many of which owe their existence to Ricardo, Democritus or Jontu.</p>
<p>The changelog is available right next to the <a href="?page=downloads">download</a>, so head there right away and check back here in two weeks, when I hope to have a smaller update for this version ready.</p>

<h2>Windows on your Lap</h2>
<p><b>posted by Urs on 15/12/2006</b></p>
<p>As of now, Anathema sports a convenient installer for Windows.</p>
<p>Originally requested - and advanced - by Jontu Kontar, it took a hiatus,
saw a complete revision and now finally is finished with all the features we originally imagined.</p>
<p>Get it via the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a> section.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that I spent the last month procrastinating. <i>Au contraire!</i></p>
<p>I took uteck's writeup of the Anathema User's Guide, refined it a bit and am finally able to present to you what should have been done three weeks ago.</p>
<p>It's available from the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a> section.</p>

<h2>Feature Complete</h2>
<p><b>posted by Urs on 22/10/2006</b></p>
<p>After two years of work, toils, sweat, tears and equal amounts of thinking, we are proud to present the first feature complete version of Anathema. Wait, didn't we have this opener once before?</p>
<p>Old text, new features: New, among others, are the great new icons and support for Equipment, Crafts and Languages.</p>
<p>Anyway, you probably know the deal: <a href="?page=downloads">Download</a> away and enjoy.</p>
