<p>As of now, Anathema sports a convenient installer for Windows.</p>
<p>Originally requested - and advanced - by Jontu Kontar, it took a hiatus,
saw a complete revision and now finally is finished with all the features we originally imagined.</p>
<p>Get it via the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a> section.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that I spent the last month procrastinating. <i>Au contraire!</i></p>
<p>I took uteck's writeup of the Anathema User's Guide, refined it a bit and am finally able to present to you what should have been done three weeks ago.</p>
<p>It's available from the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a> section.</p>

<h2>Feature Complete</h2>

<p>After two years of work, toils, sweat, tears and equal amounts of thinking, we are proud to present the first feature complete version of Anathema. Wait, didn't we have this opener once before?</p>
<p>Old text, new features: New, among others, are the great new icons and support for Equipment, Crafts and Languages.</p>
<p>Anyway, you probably know the deal: <a href="?page=downloads">Download</a> away and enjoy.</p>
