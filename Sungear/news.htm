<h2>Item Wars: The Saga Continues</h2>
<p><b>posted by Urs on 25/02/2007</b></p>
<p>The updated version of 1.1, mentioned earlier, is ready for download. It fixes everything brought to my attention over the past two weeks and some 
issues I only noticed last minute. You might experience a long startup time, but it should happen only once.<p>
<p><a href="?page=downloads">Download</a>, enjoy, and see you two weeks from now.</p>

<h2>Equipment: Incompatible</h2>
<p><b>posted by Urs on 23/02/2007</b></p>
<p>Equipment data from v1.0 will not work correctly when used in version 1.1. The database is not corrupted,
and I have since implemented a global solution. Please stand by till sunday, when I will release an updated version.<p>
<p>I am sorry for the inconvenience and apologize for the delay in notification - a long-lasting server downtime shut us off.</p>

<h2>Fixing...</h2>

<p>At long last, I am proud to present the new version of Anathema, featuring absolutely no "one big thing".
Instead, there's a plethora of updates and fixes and niceties for you to enjoy, many of which owe their existence to Ricardo, Democritus or Jontu.</p>
<p>The changelog is available right next to the <a href="?page=downloads">download</a>, so head there right away and check back here in two weeks, when I hope to have a smaller update for this version ready.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that I spent the last month procrastinating. <i>Au contraire!</i></p>
<p>I took uteck's writeup of the Anathema User's Guide, refined it a bit and am finally able to present to you what should have been done three weeks ago.</p>
<p>It's available from the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a> section.</p>
