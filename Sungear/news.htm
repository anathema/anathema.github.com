<h2>New website unveiled</h2>
<h3>posted by Urs on 05/09/2006</h3>
<p>After three month of discussion, labor, more discussion and equal amounts of refinement, we are proud to present the new Anathema website. Crafted by Martin Nerukar, known to the net as Democritus, it marks the first step towards a new, more mature look of the entire project.<br/><br/>

We hope you enjoy your stay and, as always, Anathema.<br/>
Next stop: The Lap. Please stand clear of the doors.</p>
