<h2>Technicalities</h2>

<h3>What hardware do I need to run Anathema?</h3>
	<P>See the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a> page for a detailed list of hardware requirements.</p>

<h3>What software do I need to run Anathema?</h3>
	<P>The Anathema regular releases come with everything you need, except for the
	<a href="http://java.sun.com">Java Runtime Environment</a> Version 5.  Patch releases require the appropriate
	regular release to be installed.</p>

<h3>Java is installed, but Anathema still won't run.</h3>
	<P>Make sure you upgrade your Java Runtime Environment to the latest version before running Anathema.</p>
	<p>Also, ensure that you've extracted all ZIPped files to their full pathnames.</p>
	<p>If errors persist, please ascertain that you have the latest release. The problem might already be fixed.</p>
	<p>Should all that fail, please provide the following information when contacting us:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Which version of java are you using?
		<li>What is your operating system?
		<li>Which release of Anathema causes the error?
		<li>What command or action do you use to launch Anathema?
		<li>Which plugins are installed?
	</ul>

<h3>I'd like further instructions. Any chance?</h3>
	<P>Of course. A quickstart guide can be found on the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a>
	page, while an extended installation guide is available for download on the 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=122320&package_id=144755">project page</a>.</p>

<h2>Bugs & Features</h2>

<h3>When will rule/feature X be supported?</h3>
	<P>It's hard to plan ahead more than two releases, and even then there are just as many 
	things that simply "happen to be done along the way", as there are those that "aren't that 
	important right now".<br/>
	That said, have a look at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=122320&amp;atid=693111">feature requests</a> 
	page - if your feature isn't listed there, just submit it and wait for a comment from us within the next day or so.</p>

<h3>Things don't work right! What should I do?</h3>
	<P>If you found a bug, be sure to post it over at the
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=122320&amp;atid=693108">bug report</a> page! 
	We try to fix all bugs as soon as possible, and you can make things much easier for us if you give a concise 
	description of what happened. If, in addition to finding the bug, you also know how to fix it (or just think you know), let us know!</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<h3>How can I contribute to Anathema?</h3>
	<P>The easiest way is giving feedback. Just let us know what you think,	especially what you think could be done better.<br/>
	For more in-depth-work, you could come up with documentation for the program.
	If you have an idea, but aren't certain it's suitable, just <a href="?page=contact">contact us</a>.</p>
