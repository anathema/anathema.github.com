<h2>Technicalities</h2>

<h3>What hardware/software do I need to run Anathema?</h3>
	<p>Anathema will run on any operating system with <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java Runtime Environment</a> Version 5 or later, including Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
	<P> Patch releases require the appropriate regular release to be installed.</p>
	<P>See the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a> page for an estimate of hardware requirements.</p>

<h3>Java is installed, but Anathema still won't run.</h3>
	<p>First, ensure that you've extracted all ZIPped files to their full pathnames.</p>
	<p>If errors persist, please ascertain that you have the latest release.</p>
	<p>Should all that fail, please provide the following information when contacting us:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Which version of java are you using?
		<li>What is your operating system?
		<li>Which release of Anathema causes the error?
		<li>What command or action do you use to launch Anathema?
		<li>Which plugins are installed?
	</ul>

<h3>I'd like further instructions. Any chance?</h3>
	<P>Of course. A quickstart guide can be found on the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a>
	page, while an extended installation guide is available for download on the 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=122320&package_id=144755">project page</a>.</p>

<h2>Bugs & Features</h2>

<h3>When will rule/feature X be supported?</h3>
	<P>It's hard to plan ahead more than two releases, and even then there are just as many 
	things that simply "happen to be done along the way", as there are those that "aren't that 
	important right now".<br/>
	That said, have a look at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=122320&amp;atid=693111">feature requests</a> 
	page - if your feature isn't listed there, just submit it and wait for a comment from us within the next day or so.</p>

<h3>Things don't work right! What should I do?</h3>
	<P>If you found a bug, be sure to post it over at the
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=122320&amp;atid=693108">bug report</a> page! 
	We try to fix all bugs as soon as possible, and you can make a difference by giving a concise
