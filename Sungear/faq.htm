<h2>Technicalities</h2>

<h3>What hardware/software do I need to run Anathema?</h3>
	<p>Anathema will run on any operating system with <a href="http://www.java.com">Java Runtime Environment</a> Version 5 or later, including Linux, Windows and Mac OS X 'Tiger'.</p>
	<p>The Windows version requires Java 6.</p>
	<!--<P> Patch releases require the appropriate regular release to be installed.</p>-->
	<P>See the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a> page for an estimate of hardware requirements.</p>

<h3>Java is installed, but Anathema still won't run.</h3>
	<p>First, ensure that you've extracted all ZIPped files to their full pathnames.<br/>
	If errors persist, please ascertain that you have the latest release.<br/>
	Should all that fail, please provide the following information when contacting us:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Which version of Java are you using?
		<li>What is your operating system?
		<li>Which release of Anathema causes the error? [Warning: Trick Question]
		<li>What command or action do you use to launch Anathema?
		<li>Which plugins are installed?
	</ul>
	
<h3>I'd like further instructions. Any chance?</h3>
	<P>Of course. A quickstart guide can be found on the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a>
	page. An installation guide is available for download on the 
	<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/anathema/AnathemaInstallationGuide_v1.0.pdf?download">project page</a>.</p>

<h2>Bugs & Features</h2>

<h3>Anathema does not allow for the Artifact background to be taken more than once.</h3>
<p> Take a second look at the background selection box, it is editable. Enter a description, name or number for your artifact and everything will be fine.</p>

<h3>How to add custom Charms?</h3>
<p>Go to Paul Adams' <a href="http://jontukontar.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a> to learn the ins and outs of adding Charms. He is documented his own findings in a series of work-in-progress articles,
with commentary from the Anathema developers.</p>

<h3>Despite giving my best, I am unable to install a decoder for the Music Database. What to do?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we introduced a major bug pertaining to this specific feature. As of version 1.0, it is impossible to add a decoder to the Music Database. We are sorry that the problem will not be fixed in the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3>When will rule/feature X be supported?</h3>
	<P>It's hard to plan ahead more than two releases, and even then there are just as many 
	things that simply "happen to be done along the way", as there are those that "aren't that 
	important right now". The <a href="?page=development">development</a> page will give you a glimpse of the future. <br/> <!--If we don't name your feature there, browse to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=122320&amp;atid=693111">feature requests</a> tracker and submit it after checking it's not already listed.--></p>

	We try to fix all bugs as soon as possible, and you can make a difference by giving a concise 
	description of what happened.</p>
