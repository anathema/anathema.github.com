With the complete checkin of the basic fileset, Anathema has taken it's first breath - and many more will follow.  

What's this about?  
Our goal is to provide you with an all-inclusive solution to Exalted campaign management, or, as stated in the project summary, a solution for "harmonic Exalted management".  

So, it's just another character generator?  
I'll be up-front with you: It is. Now.  
But character generation is only the beginning. Apart from character advancement and character management, we plan on providing a suite to suit every aspect of your Exalted series:  
* Confused by the course of events?  
Create a outline for your campaign, chapters or sessions, even single scenes in it.  
* Tired of reading notes on an illegible stack of wrinkled paper?  
Enter them into a new note in Anathema and attach them to your campagin or character.  
* Want to establish recurring theme for a characters, a place or an event?  
Create a playlist for it and send it to your favorite media player.

The only downside: Patience is needed, for we are only beginning.

Watch out - emergent Anathema have been spotted.
