Just like everyone's favorite eastern metropolis was taken down by the onslaught of Fair Folk and Contagion, the release bearing it's name was rendered useless by oversights on my part. I am about to replace the release.

Thanks to uteck and an anonymous user, who found what should have been ours to find: The missing report files and the inability to save notes.

There's no optional patch this time, as I cannot imagine that anyone would want to go with a version like this.

Sorry, everyone
