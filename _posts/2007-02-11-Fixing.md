<p>At long last, I am proud to present the new version of Anathema, featuring absolutely no "one big thing".
Instead, there's a plethora of updates and fixes and niceties for you to enjoy, many of which owe their existence to Ricardo, Democritus or Jontu.</p>
<p>The changelog is available right next to the <a href="/downloads">download</a>, so head there right away and check back here in two weeks, when I hope to have a smaller update for this version ready.</p>
