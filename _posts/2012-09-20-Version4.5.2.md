layout: post
---

We resume our regular schedule with freshly released v4.5.2.

This one went through one additional cycle of tests and should run without issues.
But that's not all:  Francisco M Neto contributes a Portuguese translation, Dragon-Blooded can learn Martial Arts again, and last but not least, we finally have the update system under control.
Going forward - with the next update - you shouldn't experience any more hickups.

For now, though, if you encouter problems automatically updating, please shut down the program and download from here.
And please, please tell us.
