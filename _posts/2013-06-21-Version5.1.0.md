Anathema 5.1 is ready!
After a prolonged downtime, much tinkering, fixing and improving and an ardous bugfixing phase,
this new release brings you a first taste of our revamped UI, a major fix for Sidereal, many bugfixes for various Charms and some small new features.

Unfortunately, you'll have to uninstall your current installation (save your data first!) and re-install this new version.
We are sorry for the inconvenience. :-/ The new UI wouldn't play nicely with old versions of Java, so we had to bundle a fresh one.
(If you see something in the update manager, it is v5.0.2. Its sole purpose is to inform you that nothing more will come that way.)

Bugfixes pending, this will be our final release for Exalted, Second Edition, as we will concentrate on 3E from here on forward.
If you want to expand the tool for the current edition, please talk to us.
Here is the full (albeit minimal) [changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/v5.1.0/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.md).
