Well, we're in the last stages of preparing to release version 1.5.0. What's 1.5.0? It's a release of Anathema that's centered around the new Dawn Solution charms and character creation changes, just as 1.4.2 was centered on the fixed Dreams of the First Age charms. 1.5.0 also includes template support for Dreams of the First Age Dragon-bloods and Solars (though the Solar support's a little shaky yet). We've still got a little work to do before 1.5.0 is released, but it's nearly there.
