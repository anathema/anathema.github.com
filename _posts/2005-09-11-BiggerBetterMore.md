When I last wrote here, I told you the next release would take some more time - time that has finally passed. Last time I wrote, the system was in a state of disarray, with lots of things needing polish. This polish applied and even some more features added, Anathema 0.8 is complete.

"What's new?", as always, is the most interesting question. Here goes: Sidereals are in. Power Combat is supported. Dragon-Blooded Templates from "The Outcaste" were added. We made a major update to the look and feel.
And: We took the time to get back to our original vision of Anathema and begun work on the music database. The result is a separate module, which can be included by extracting the archive to the "modules" folder. It is meant to aid storytellers in categorizing music for their series. Future versions will allow linking music to scenes or characters.
Kudos go to Philip "The_Burrito" Markus and Patches, who provided Charm and spell data.

We had hoped for this iteration to include an equipment-module, but time did not permit. I hope it will be done next time. Same goes for another sleight of Dragon-Blooded, including Immaculate monks and Lookshy denizens.
Thanks for your patience - let's hope that the next release doesn't take as long.

'till then
