Delayed by a week by illness, the new version of Anathema, "Chiaroscuro", is ready for your perusal.

Within lie the results of the last week's work, namely the ability to print character sheets without any
further restrictions, and to view many many different charm trees.  
The latter feature is to no small part the merit of our new team member, hd42, whose name you might
have heard otherwise in the context of the game. He has created a tool that creates the Charmtree-Graphics
without human interference, thus saving much tedious work.  
This results not only in completely redone Solar Charm Trees, but also in the Sidereal and Terrestrial 
Charmtrees already present.  
Additionally, charm data is shown in the form of tooltips.

Apart from that, there are some cleanups done: Combos can be cleared on mouseclick, and are adjusted
automatically if the contained charms are unlearned. Some bugs have been fixed, and that, as they say,
is that.

Next: Basic Campaign Management. 

See you in about a month,
