Months later than I wanted it to, the bugfix release is finally out. It took a while for me to get to terms with some things, and another while till the translations came in.
Some among you will note that the spanish translation is <i>still</i> incomplete, and I am sad to tell you that it might stay so for a while, since our translator, Ricardo, was struck by illness. I hope he'll get better soon.

This release marks a deviation from SOP, since major parts were not written by me, not by Sandra, but by third parties, namely Gareth and Onii. Having made good experience with them, we have decided to open up the program and 
now accept contributions from anyone.

Since some more submissions from their side are already waiting in the pipeline, I hope it won't be too long until you see the first new features roll out.

Feel free to <a href="/contact.html">contact</a> me about the details once your [download](/downloads.html) is done.
