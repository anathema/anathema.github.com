Again, five weeks have passed, again it's time for a regular release of Anathema.  
Much has changed over the past month. Where to begin?  

The most prominent of changes is the addition of a module for series management. Still being under construction, it already allows you to keep an overview over you campaign's plot and manage it in an easy, tree like fashion complete with drag and drop and stylable text.  
Note - which I, in a rash thought, had promised could be attached to characters by now - are there, but are stand alone as of now, but linking functions will come up soon.  
We added hotkeys for the more important features, revamped much of the underlying technical stuff and - again, a more obvious change - got a new tab for displaying items. Not only does it look neat, it also allows for a per-view close-button.  
Speaking of buttons, most of the buttons now have ToolTips to explain the icons, which, in turn, are now present on every button.

The more feasible of feature requests have been solved, as have next to all bugs we curently know of - including the infamous repository-issue on Linux systems! (See release notes for details.)

From the "Cool People" division, this month features Xanatos and uteck, the former to bring us an icon for your desktop pleasure, the latter to write an Anathema User's Guide to be inspected in the "Documentation" section.

Take care, and see you next month (or so), surely with more good news on campaigns and maybe even with some character advancement.
