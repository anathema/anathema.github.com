We did it.

Finally, two weeks after the date we aimed for, Anathema 0.1, codenamed "Abalone" is released to the public.  
Head right over to the file section and download the full distribution (It's quite big because it's packed with third party libraries, but you won't have to download these anew every time.) and have a look at what we were talking about for the last month.   
It's not much, at first glance, only the most basic of features are covered - however, the sound framework underneath had to be built, too, and will (hopefully) allow for good progress in the future.  

I'm happy we've made it so far and hope you stay with us on our trip - next stop: Solar Exalted.
