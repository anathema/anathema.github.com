When I was encouraged to join this project, I did not think I could do it. Never did things like that before. Thought I'd not be up to the task, that I'd call it quits after a month or two, ruining the fun for both of us. I did it anyway.

One year later, Anathema is widely successful. The community response is impressive and encouraging, ranging from "good job" mails, blog posts discussing the program and feature requests to freely offered assistance 
from people who never even heard of Exalted before. Thanks to all of you.

In this release, we adress some more features from the backlist, like Immaculates and support for the entire Martial Arts ruleset from the Player's Guide, add
a random name generator and finally allow characters to attain Essence 7.
Equipment? Yeah... well... no. Instead, there are the beginnings of a system for Merits and Flaws.

Kudos to voidstate for allowing us to use his name-particle-database, and even more so to Ricardo,
who has not only created a barrel full of Dragon-Blooded templates but also kept double checking our work, finding many potential issues. Thanks!

Most probably, this is the last release in the current year. We want to address some more technical
problems next, which might take a while.

So, have a look at our anniversary edition, look forward to the first issue of the comic and check back when the christmas tree is cold again.

Regards
