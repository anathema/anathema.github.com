<p>Equipment data from v1.0 will not work correctly when used in version 1.1. The database is not corrupted,
and I have since implemented a global solution. Please stand by till sunday, when I will release an updated version.<p>
<p>I am sorry for the inconvenience and apologize for the delay in notification - a long-lasting server downtime shut us off.</p>
