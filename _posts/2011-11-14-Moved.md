Do not be alarmed: We moved house. 

Our website now resides at github, along with [our code](http://github.com/anathema/anathema). The new URL is [``http://anathema.github.com``](http://anathema.github.com). 

Of course, you can always reach us via the old [``http://anathema.sf.net``](http://anathema.sf.net) and be redirected here.

Update 1:   
For you, this means two things:  
First, you can now easily [fork our code](http://github.com/anathema/anathema) and do whatever you want with it - and if you're done, send a pull request so your results become part of the next release of Anathema.  
Second, you can now read these posts in your favorite feed-reader. Here is [RSS](http://anathema.github.com/rss.xml) and there is [Atom](http://anathema.github.com/atom.xml).  

Update 2:  
Thanks to our own Eric and Sonya at github, we now reside at ``anathema.github.com``.  
(This post originally pointed to ``exalted-rpg.github.com``.)
