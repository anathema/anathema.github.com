Do not be alarmed: We moved house. 

Our website now resides at github, along with [our code](http://github.com/exalted-rpg/anathema). The new URL is [``http://exalted-rpg.github.com``](http://exalted-rpg.github.com). 

Of course, you can always reach us via the old [``http://anathema.sf.net``](http://anathema.sf.net) and be redirected here.

Update: 
For you, this means two things:
First, you can now easily [fork our code](http://github.com/exalted-rpg/anathema) and do whatever you want with it - and if you're done, send a pull request so your results become part of the next release of Anathema.
Second, you can now read these posts in your favorite feed-reader. Here is [RSS](http://exalted-rpg.github.com/rss.xml) and there is[Atom] (http://exalted-rpg.github.com/atom.xml).
