It was just two hours ago that we decided that the code, now containing Dragon-Blooded and Eclipse features, once again was release-ready, and so here it is: Anathema 0.7, a week earlier than expected.

So, the Solar Eclipses as well as Abyssal Moonshadow caste are finally supported, as are everyone's favorite decadent dynasts. Many a bug is gone (and hopefully only few added) and the Charm system has been extended to support alternate prerequisites such as the Dragon-Blooded's elemental resistance charms.

Data wise, there are many new Charms (Kudos to Ricardo!) and even more spells.

We're still wondering whether a power combat-feature is still of use with 2nd Edition on the horizon. What do you think? 

'til next time
