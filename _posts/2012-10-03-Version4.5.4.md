Anathema 4.5.4 is ready, but there are few tangible changes, and all of them are bugfixes.

Best news this week is that we can publish a version and announce it on 4 channels in less than 10 minutes.
And that we got rid of a really old piece of code.
Busy busy busy - but with RL, mostly.

As always, here is the full [changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/v4.5.4/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.md).
