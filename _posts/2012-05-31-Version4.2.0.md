Bad news: It's vacation time, so we skipped a release.
Good news: That gave us time for some overdue changes.

Anathema 4.2.0 is ready, and sports all-new character navigation.
Most of the tabs are gone, and the categories are condensed and more clearly labeled.
Have a look for yourself, and please tell us what you think:

There are some bugfixes and a neat improvement to Equipment. Here's the full [changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/da9a26b4d08ef825ed3d822b4c8e4deb6e7c4e07/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.md).
