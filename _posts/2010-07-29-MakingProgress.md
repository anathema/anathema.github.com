<p>Hello to everyone. Eric Astor here, a long-time Anathema user - and now one of your new developers. As Urs pointed out in his last post, Craig's time is not infinite, but the wonders of open source mean that others can contribute to the project as well. We've had it pointed out that we haven't been good about keeping the community up-to-date yet, and this is our first attempt to change that.</p>
<p>Some work had been done on a fork of Anathema before Urs handed this site over to us, and during our silence, we've been working on merging those changes into Anathema. The current plan is for the next release to include proper support for the books released to date - or, at least, as many of them as we can manage - and some significant bug fixes. For instance, we are aware of the bug that causes Armor to become unchecked on the Equipment screen after saving and reloading a character, and that bug will certainly be patched!</p>
<p>Once we finish this merge and a few patches, which should be fairly soon now, we'll post a new release of Anathema - version 1.4.1. Keep an eye out here for future updates!</p>
