A number of bugs has been reported and fixed thanks to the open eyes and helpful hands of some users, expecially Xanatos and Lazarus.

We are considering releasing a patch for v0.3 shortly, once the smoke has somewhat settled, so you aren't bound to that bug-hefty release for long.

Just to let you know
