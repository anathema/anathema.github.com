Two years in the making, Anathema 1.0 is finally here. Featuring character and series management and a music database, Anathema aims to be the one stop tool for all your Exalted needs.

This latest release adds options for handling equipment and more accurate treatment of the crafts ability. It also features brand new artwork by Martin 'Democritus' Nerurkar.

Kudos to everyone who helped over the past two years, especially Ricardo, wordman, ipsi, Jontu and uteck. And of course, Sandra. Without her, I wouldn't be sitting here, writing this. Thanks!

Enjoy Anathema
