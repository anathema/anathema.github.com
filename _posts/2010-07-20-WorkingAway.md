Well, we're making progress. At the moment, the task is merging changes that were made to create an interim release with the Outcaste R3 code, so we don't lose anything that was in the program before the new team started working on it and took a detour I shouldn't have taken. Once we get that merge completed, then it will be time to start looking into what we're going to add next.
