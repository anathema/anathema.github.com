<b>v5.0.0 has a nasty issue, we have removed the server.</b>

Anathema 5.0.0 is out, and finally brings us to Java 7.
To keep the hassle for you to a minimum, the bundles for Windows and OS X now include the Java environment. You no longer need to worry about it.
If you are on Linux, please make sure you have it installed.

This allows OS X's gatekeeper to treat Anathema more kindly, so you will no longer see it as "damaged".
It also allows us to keep the internals less dependent on your system.  
Apart from that, nothing to see here.

Please note that the impact of the change keeps us from offering an automatic update.   
If you want to continue receiving updates, <b>please uninstall Anathema, download v5.0 and re-install it</b>.

(If you see something in the update manager, it is v4.5.5. Its sole purpose is to inform you that nothing more will come that way.)

Here is the full [changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/v5.0.0/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.md).
