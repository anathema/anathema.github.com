Hello again,  
things are progressing steadily:  
With the integration of the old exalted.core packages into the overall net.sf.anathema structure, the Complete Charm Cascades are now officially part of Anathema and provide the foundation for the soon-to-be-implemented charm-selection features.

In other news, I've submitted my first designs for the Abyssal, Sidereal and Dragonblooded Charm Icons and recreated the ones for the Solars, this time staying more faithful to the original image.

See them within Anathema - we plan for a release as soon as Charms are done!
