Since late 2011, we have slowly been moving our infrastructure to new systems.  
First, we moved this website to github, where our [source code](github.com/anathema/anathema) soon followed. 
They track our [issues](github.com/anathema/anathema/issues) as well.  

This month, with the advent of the in-program updates, we shifted our [Downloads](http://anathema.github.com/downloads.html) to our own private server.  
Yesterday, we shut down our old mailing list and open up a [new list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/anathema-development) at Google Groups.

With that final act, we are finally leaving our place at sourceforge.net for good.  
If you still have a bookmark to anathema.sf.net, that's no big thing, the address will remain available for the foreseeable future.  
If you wrote to or watched the old list, please update your address book or just visit the link above to use it like a web forum.
