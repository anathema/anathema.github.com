After a night of fixing and a series of tests, I have uploaded Anathema 5.0.1.
Its sole advantage over the previous version? It actually works as intended.

Apart from that, all that was true for 5.0.0 still holds:
We now bundle Java, so you don't need to worry about it. 
You'll have less trouble with OS X's Gatekeeper.
We're on Java 7 now.

Please note that the impact of the change keeps us from offering an automatic update - even if you already use v5.0.0.
If you want to continue receiving updates, <b>please uninstall Anathema, download v5.0.1 and re-install it</b>.

(If you see something in the update manager, it is v4.5.5. Its sole purpose is to inform you that nothing more will come that way.)

Here is the full (albeit minimal) [changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/v5.0.1/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.md).
