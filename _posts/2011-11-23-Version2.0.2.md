Anathema 2.0.2 is out.
If you could not create (or even load) characters with the previous version, please give this one a try.
You can download the entire [release](/downloads.html), or just grab the [replacement file](http://sourceforge.net/projects/anathema/files/Anathema%202.0.2%20Calibration/core.jar/download) and put it in your ``plugins`` folder.

A big "Thank you" goes out to [Attila Kelemen](http://github.com/kelemen), who made this possible.

Do you want to add to Anathema? Why not [fork the project](http://github.com/anathema/anathema), do your stuff and send us a pull request!
If you don't find your way around, watch this space - we'll have a detailed guide shortly!
