Version 3.1.1 rides into town, bringing new features and bugfixes in equal measure.  
If you're looking for Exalted 2.5, this is not what you're waiting for.  
We have new charm descriptions, improvements to the sheet and the first change to our Charm breakup since I don't know when.

Also, with 2.5 arriving, we have decided to start phasing out the support for older editions.  
There might be another release or two, but we'll put our focus on "current" Exalted.
