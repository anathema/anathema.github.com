Finally, it's done.  

Some days later than originally planned, our most ambitious release so far is ready and the Abyssal Exalted finally are at your fingertips.  
With them, of course, they bring all the things you expect from Anathema:  
All the Charms ever published laid out as Charm Cascades, pretty printing character sheets, and of course a best spend calculator for Bonus Points, (including, but in no way limited to) calculations on where to spend the points granted by the Liege Background.

Also, all the 'special' Charms have been modelled into our largely restructured character management system.  
Better yet: You can discern between loyal and renegade Abyssals, using the newly created Character Template system.  
What else? The cool person of the month, most obviously, is Ricardo Rodriguez, whose spanish translation is another big 'new' in this release. Some stuff is inofficial, but he sticked to the existent translation wherever possible. Just let us know if you notice any differences.  
Thanks also go to Eisenstein for pointing out a bug in the Willpower handling.  
There are, as always, some minor improvements - just look at the change log for a complete list.  

I hope you like what we've done. Head right over to the 'Files' area to grab the files, and note that there's an upgrade package for all the people who already have Anathema 0.5 installed.

As you probably know, this is where I ask for feedback, so we might improve even more. No change here, but this time, it's twice as important:  
In order to plan future releases, we'd be glad to know what character type you would most like to see in the program.

Thanks for your support
