Thanks to the esteemed Rafaela Lombardino, the Anathema website is now available in Spanish. Use the flags on the lower left to select the language to show.

Grateful Plug: Miss Lombardino, a professional translator for Spanish, English and Portuguese can be contacted via http://rml-languages.translatedlyrics.com/.

In other news: I've taken the liberty to create an Anathema Installation Guide. It will soon be available from the project page.
The next release, unfortunately, will still take some time - we went head-first into all-new territory, and things still need some polishing.

Bye

Update: Sincere aplogies, Rafaela, I got your name wrong the first time

Update in 2011: The spanish version is no longer available.
