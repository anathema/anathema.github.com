title: New Users' Guide available - Wiki free for all.
layout: post
---

Following a random mood, I've revisited both the [installation guide and the users' guide](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/wiki/Guide) and moved both of them to the [wiki](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/wiki/).
The effect is threefold:

* The guide is more current.
* The guide is easier to access.
* The guide is free to edit.

That's right: Access to the wiki is no longer limited to team members.   
If you find an error, would like to add a section, or have a great idea on how to design the thing... _go nuts!_
