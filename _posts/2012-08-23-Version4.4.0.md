Today, we release Anathema 4.4.0. It is another release with a strong technical side, its main point being an update to the age-old Charm cascades.
I hope you like the new look, and enjoy the way faster updates.

As always, here is the full (if short) [changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/v4.4.0/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.md).
