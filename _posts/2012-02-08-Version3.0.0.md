Thanks to everyone who contributed:  
[Sean](http://github.com/JMobius), [Eric](http://github.com/ericastor), Erin, Douglas, [Scott](http://github.com/the-smith) and [Rob](http://github.com/rlrutherford) implemented most of the changes,
with [Sandra](http://github.com/vestrial) coming on late for some critical fixes.  
[Attila Kelemen](http://github.com/kelemen) contributed bugfixes and corrections.

Speaking of Attila, he recently released a [combat tracker](https://github.com/kelemen/ExaltedCombat) and is pondering closer integration with Anathema.  
We love to hear from you if you have thoughts on the matter!

Do you want to add to Anathema yourself?  
Why not [fork the project](http://github.com/anathema/anathema), do your stuff and send us a pull request!

**Update**: We're still having some trouble with the Windows installer. It will follow soon.
