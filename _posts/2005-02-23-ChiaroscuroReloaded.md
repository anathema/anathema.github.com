As I'm writing this, the files containing the promised patch are being uploaded to the Sourceforge server. Shortly, they should be publicly available.  
Apart from the most prominent Bugfix - the Charm Trees work once again on non-Windows systems - there is one problem less with resizing Windows and a properly working edit function for previously entered Virtue Flaws.  
Some wrong charmtrees were fixed, too.  

Special thanks to Lazarus, Xanatos and anowack for spotting these problems.

Apart from those fixes, there's a tad of new feature also - as requested, identical Specialties are now treated as one and have a rating, just like Abilities and Attributes.  
Apart from that, many new Martial Arts charmtrees have been added - every single one from the Solar Castebooks as well as the styles from the Dragon-Blooded Hardback. 

Enjoy, while we get back to the scheduled work
