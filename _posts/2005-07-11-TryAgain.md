Once more, we have to rely on a patch release to fix some serious issues with the newly added features. Everyone who has experienced problems with the Abyssal Exalted or with the calculation of Breeding-enhanced Essence pools is strongly advised to update.

What adds to my feeling of guilt is that all of the features mentioned where mine to implement. I intend to do better next time, and return to my coder's cave, which is all plushy with power-combat goodness by now.

With best hopes for a bug-free month
