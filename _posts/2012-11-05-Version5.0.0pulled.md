I have removed the 5.0.0 download from our server.
In that version, the automatic update is critically broken, and I don't want the issue to spread.
v4.5.5 has all the same features and fixes, please use that one until the issue is resolved.

If you already have the version, it's no big thing - you just have to download it all once again.

Thanks for your patience
