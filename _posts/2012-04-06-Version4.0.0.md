"Exalted 2.5" is here.
<ul><center><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=122320">Get Anathema for Exalted 2.5</a></center></ul>

This release brings major changes: With it, we drop support for First Edition and pre-errata Second Edition.
To make up, Anathema now supports [Exalted 2.5](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/84593/Scroll-of-Errata), can finally print Charm Cards, has a renovated sheet in landscape format, and finally helps you managing your Charms' details.
As always, a full list of changes awaits in [our changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/master/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.txt).

Of course, a version supporting games using vintage rules will always remain available:
<ul><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/anathema/files/Anathema%203.1.2/">Get Anathema for 1st Edition, Power Combat or "classic" Second Edition</a></ul>
If you have games using both Exalted 2.5 and classic rules, you can use both versions in parallel.
