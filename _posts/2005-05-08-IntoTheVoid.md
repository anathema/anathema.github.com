Hi again everyone,  
it's been five weeks since the last version of Anathema, and as usual, we're back with a brand-sparkling-new release.

We finally got around to work at the most frequent feature requests: Character Advancement, XP Management and a largely advanced character sheet (modeled after Voidstate's, in case you hadn't guessed it) will now allow you to use Anathema not only at creation but during the whole length of your series.  
Linux user's now finally can rejoice: A preferences dialog enables you to store your preferred working directory directly in the program, without the need for that cloggy command line parameter.  
But there's even more customizability coming : It is now possible to custom-edit the natures presented by the program - have a look at the instructions in the data directory for more information. Better yet: It even shows (and, of course prints) your Willpower recovery condition. 

And: We managed to decrease the download size once more.The only bad thing is that there're still too many of them fundamental changes to allow for an simple update. But that, we're working on.  

See you next month, then with some Player's Guide Goodness and our first new charactertype ...*drums rolling*... the Abyssal Exalted finally join the crowd!

Thanks for your support, and don't forget to leave feedback!
