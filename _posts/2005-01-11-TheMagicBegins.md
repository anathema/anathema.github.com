One month has passed since we released the first version of Anathema, which was, incidentally, well received - much better than we expected, given it's rather limited functionality.

Less incidentally, those limitations have been lifted to some extent: As promised, the Solar Exalted are now a fully functional charactertype within the generation module.   
The magic of the Chosen is at your command, as are the Virtue Flaws. Better yet: Anathema - to my knowledge - is the first tool to offer fully graphical charm selection.   
No tables, no trees - see at one glance what charms are there and which will follow.

We will take a break from the character creation module and have a look at character sheet printing next - stay with us and make sure you report your thoughts on this version, the input we received so far was most valuable.

Thanks and have fun with Anathema 0.2: 'Bluehaven'
