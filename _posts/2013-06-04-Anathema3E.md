It's been a while since we had significant news to report, but today, they come two at a time:

First, the Exalted 3E Kickstarter has just added a stretch goal that essentially means that Onyx Path will support us rules to make Anathema for 3E an even better tool than it was before. Of course, the program will remain free for all.  
If you like to see this happen, please support the [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/200664283/deluxe-exalted-3rd-edition)!

Second, we're on the verge of our final release for Second Edition, with new looks and fixed bugs.  
Just a couple more days!
