<p>Anathema is back! As of yesterday, version 1.4.1 of Anathema is officially released, and new development continues apace. Windows and multi-platform versions are already available, with a .dmg release for the Mac just awaiting the attention of one of our developers with a Mac. Downloads are available in the ordinary way. In addition, the bug tracker has been shifted back to SourceForge; we welcome all bug reports and feature requests to guide our future development. We'd particularly appreciate contributions to the Rule Support Request tracker!</p>
