It is done. And (depending on your point of view) it's even a day early. The latest in our ongoing series of beta releases features the one thing everyone's been talking about those past 3 month: Exalted, Second Edition. Solars as well as mortals, complete with Intimacies and a brand sparkling new character sheet. A complete list of changes awaits in the release notes.

This new sheet marks a major deviation from our previous sheets, both in the technology used and in the design itself. We tried to stick to the "look & feel" created by voidstate for his first edition sheet, all the while incorporating what we felt was best about the various second edition sheets around. 
It's the first sheet I dare to say is "ours" instead just a clone of some other sheet, and it will replace the existing designs for the First Edition as we go along. That means, of course, that we're more eager than ever to hear your comments and ideas.

Since last time I wrote here, wordman has joined our team. His job is creating releases for the mac, as demonstrated with the 10.1 version. He will create and upload a dedicated file for Mac users in due time. If there's anything Mac specific that deserves improvement, tell us 
outright. 

More news: Anathema is now accepting donations. (Special thanks to Harbo-Torres, our first donor.) We had planned to acquire licenses for the fonts used in the sourcebooks, but that seems out of reach. We will announce the new plan shortly. 

Those reading my LiveJournal might remember the mountain range I was talking about.  
Standing on the peak, I can tell you that there are even higher mountains ahead.   
And the view is most beautiful.
