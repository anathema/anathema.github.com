<p>Despite the time I spent in trains this past three months, I did some work on Anathema.</p>
<p>There are cool new controls in the charm screens, immaculate monks, italian text...<br/>
and a whole bunch of people involved in finding good solutions to it all.</p>
<p>Maybe you start your <a href="/downloads">download</a> and head to the <a href="/credits">credits</a> to learn who they are.</p>
