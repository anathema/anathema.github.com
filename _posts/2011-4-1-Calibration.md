title: Calibration - Version 2.0.0

<p>It's that time of the year again - Calibration, the time when all things align. And this year, one more thing has aligned: version 2.0.0 of Anathema! Versions are available for Linux, Windows, and OS X - though a proper .DMG release for OS X may take a day or two longer to show up. We've made a few changes... we've caught up to Ink Monkeys again, there's now a new filter for Charm trees, and we've fixed some older (mostly minor) problems.</p>
<p>Oh, I did promise you all that version 2.0 would contain Second Edition Abyssals, didn't I?</p>
<p>It seems we've managed to overdeliver. Enjoy the additional features!</p>
