You read that right: [v3.1.3](http://anathema.butatopanto.de:8081/full/3.1.3/Anathema_v3.1.3.zip) awaits.  
Giovanni, a player of the old-school-persuasion, found an issue with Sidereals and asked us to fix it.  

Well, the fix is in, and it seems proper to share it with everyone.

Please note that this version is only relevant for those of you playing 'legacy' versions of Exalted:

  * First Edition
  * Power Combat or
  * Second Edition 'Classic'
  
  
For everyone using the current set of rules, *Exalted 2.5*, Anathema 5.1.3 is still the place to be.  
(Here is the full [changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/v5.1.3/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.md) for that version,
