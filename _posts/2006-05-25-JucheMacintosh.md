Wordman has sent me a pre-compiled .dmg file of Anathema v0.10 (+ Patch + Music) for easier integration with Mac OS X. It's available from the download-section.

He has also advised me on improving the usability of the program on the Mac, first results of this will be in the next release.

In other news, Second Edition is coming along steadily, but is more complicated than I first thought.

Urs, out.
