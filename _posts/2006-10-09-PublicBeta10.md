I just released a beta version of our upcoming release, Anathema 1.0.
If you don't know whether you should download it, you shouldn't. (Wait for the final release two weeks from now, on October 22nd. )

There might be errors within. Do NOT use it with your active characters without copying them first, lest they become corrupted.

If you encounter any errors, slips or anything you think should be improved (within reason), report it immediately, using any means necessary, up to and including private email, even you previously reported it - chances are we just forgot to fix it.
We depend on you to make the final release stable and enjoyable for everyone.

Thanks for your help and enjoy Anathema
