With 4.5.1 out, Anathema should finally back to calmer winds.
This version does nothing but bring the program back to a runnable state.

If you have already downloaded v4.5.0 and thus broken your installation, please re-install or follow [these steps](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/wiki/How-to-revert-to-the-originally-installed-version) to get back to the auto-updater.

Since no one enjoyed the features of 4.5 yet, here's what you get:
Custom character templates are finally possible.
We have improved support for Divine Transcendency, and incorporated much feedback you gave us to improve the Charm cascades and the update screen from v4.4 and v4.3 respectively.

If you encouter problems automatically updating, please shut down the program and download from here.
And please, please tell us.
