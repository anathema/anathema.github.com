This release has many great contributions from the relentless [Curtis Tasker](http://github.com/curttasker), 
and owes many of the improvements on the data side to [caveat](http://github.com/caveat).
Here's the full [changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/10f57ef3950dd560f7da0358b25b02526e8455f1/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.txt).

Anathema is now licensed under GPLv3 - which changes exactly nothing for most of you.

If you are still playing 1E or 2E, please use this version:
