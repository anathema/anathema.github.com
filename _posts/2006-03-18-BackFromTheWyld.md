In the latest episode of Anathema:
- Lunars attack!
- Charmtrees rush in (and out, if you will them to)!
- Bugs are diminished!
- And many subtle things no one will ever notice

That's right, folks: We're not dead.
We've spent much time, more than expected in fact, cleaning things up, improving and making future changes easier to handle.
Afterwards, a month was lost to a damaged PC.
Then, Lunars came. I hope you like them.

Thanks go to uteck and kuruderu, who did their best to keep my motivation up.
Thanks also to mrsuteck, who performed some beta testing.
Special thanks (as always, I presume) to Ricardo Rodriguez.

Upgrading from version 0.9 should be possible. No matter if you upgrade or download the entire archive, some previously 
saved characters might become invalid - I had to fix the combo rules and some charm prerequisites.
If you encounter such problems, submit your character via the newly enabled "Support" section, we will fix it.

Anyone using development versions of Anathema (by downloading the sources from the version control system) should note that we are abandoning CVS. From now on, all updates will be submitted to the Subversion (SVN) server. For details, head to the Subversion section on the project page

Next? Character-wise, I am torn between Illuminated Solars and 2nd Edition support. 
Also, there might be some additions to campaign management.
And Equipment, but that's old news...

Those of you interested in the latest news might head over to http://urskr.livejournal.com, where I will try to document our progress.

See you next time - I hope it won't take half a year again
