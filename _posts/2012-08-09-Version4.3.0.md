Anathema 4.3.0 awaits - and while we have little to show on the game-side of things, the technical side gets a major update:  
Starting with this version, Anathema can automatically update itself if you ask it to.  
The technology behind the feature was kindly sponsored by my employer at [IDOS AE GmbH](http://www.idos.de).  

In related news, starting with this version, we will host the full versions ourselves. This is no big change if download through our website,
but if not, please update your bookmarks.
