Do you own spanish Exalted sourcebooks? Would you like to contribute to Anathema?

As the main translator only owns the core rulebook in spanish, we are now looking for people who could provide charm and spell titles from the various sourcebooks already published in spanish.  
So, if you own any of these books, and would like to help, please drop me a line. No special skills needed!

Bye
