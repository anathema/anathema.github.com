title: Anathema 4.5.3 - And Logging to all...
layout: post
---

Anathema 4.5.3 is now available, and makes some improvements to overall usability.
For the first time in our almost-8 year history we write a log file with infos and issues,
so when you have a problem, a look at this file - or just sending it over - can help a great deal.

Also, the interface is finally stable, so the elements don't jump between launches.

Hope you enjoy the release.
As always, here is the full [changelog](https://github.com/anathema/anathema/blob/v4.5.3/Development_Documentation/Distribution/English/versions.md).
