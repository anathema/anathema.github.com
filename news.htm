<h2>Calibration - Version 2.0.0</h2>
<p><b>posted by Eric on 1/4/2011</b></p>
<p>It's that time of the year again - Calibration, the time when all things align. And this year, one more thing has aligned: version 2.0.0 of Anathema! Versions are available for Linux, Windows, and OS X - though a proper .DMG release for OS X may take a day or two longer to show up. We've made a few changes... we've caught up to Ink Monkeys again, there's now a new filter for Charm trees, and we've fixed some older (mostly minor) problems.</p>
<p>Oh, I did promise you all that version 2.0 would contain Second Edition Abyssals, didn't I?</p>
<p>It seems we've managed to overdeliver. Enjoy the additional features!</p>
<b>Changelog:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved existing features:
    <ul>
      <li>Created a unified "First Age Solar" template to replace the five distinct First Age Caste templates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Assorted minor bugs fixed, including some errors in Charm descriptions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for even more new material:
    <ul>
      <li>Ink Monkeys is supported through vol. 48.</li>
      <li>Added filter (by source) options to Charm trees, for ease of use and viewing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Oh - and one more thing...<br>
    Added support for some new Second Edition templates:
    <ul>
      <li>Abyssals (Loyal, Renegade)</li>
      <li>Lunars (First Age, Second Age [including Casteless])</li>
      <li>Sidereals (First Age, Second Age [including Ronin])</li>
    </ul>
    Eclipse and Moonshadow castes can learn other Exalts' Charms, as appropriate.
  </li>
</ul>
<b>Planned changes for the near-future:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Improve our support for Simple charms combo-able with charms of other abilities.</li>
  <li>Improved item support, including attunement costs and other effects.</li>
  <li>Persistence of Limit and other related concepts.</li>

  <li>Support for God-Bloods and Demon-Bloods, as well as Spirit Charms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.5.0</h2>
<p><b>posted by Eric on 14/11/2010</b></p>
<p>Welcome to Lookshy! I'm talking about version 1.5.0 of Anathema, released yesterday with versions available for Linux, Windows, and OS X. Enjoy!</p>
<b>Changelog:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support for much new material:
    <ul>
      <li>Ink Monkeys is supported through vol. 37. Charms now cite Ink Monkeys as their source, with the "page number" specifying the volume in which they appear.</li>
      <li>Scroll of Errata is supported through today, including all Dawn Solution material.</li>
      <li>Character creation templates from Dreams of the First Age are now included, though not all of their features are supported just yet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Many bugs fixed:
    <ul>
      <li>Invincible Essence Reinforcement now correctly modifies Natural Soak.</li>
      <li>The descriptions of all Necromancy and Sorcery spells now display correctly.</li>
      <li>It's no longer possible to give Anathema a repository location where it lacks the permissions to create the repository; this previously left Anathema crashing on load.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Known problems:
    <ul>
      <li>The Solar Melee charm tree is currently a bit of a mess, due to the sheer number of charms overwhelming our layout algorithm. Hopefully, this will be fixed soon.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>Planned changes for the near-future:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Improve our support for Simple charms combo-able with charms of other abilities.</li>
  <li>Improved item support, including attunement costs and other effects.</li>
  <li>Persistence of Limit and other related concepts.</li>
  <li>Support for Divine Transcendence, Glory to the Most High, and other Essence-altering effects.</li>
  <li>Second Edition Abyssals! (This will be version 2.0.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.4.1</h2>
<p><b>posted by Eric on 22/08/2010</b></p>
<p>Anathema is back! As of yesterday, version 1.4.1 of Anathema is officially released, and new development continues apace. Windows and multi-platform versions are already available, with a .dmg release for the Mac just awaiting the attention of one of our developers with a Mac. Downloads are available in the ordinary way. In addition, the bug tracker has been shifted back to SourceForge; we welcome all bug reports and feature requests to guide our future development. We'd particularly appreciate contributions to the Rule Support Request tracker!</p>
<b>Changelog:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Many bugs fixed; if you've had problems, please give the new version a try, and submit the bugs to the new tracker if they're still present.
  </li>
  <li>
    2E support for Dragon-Bloods and Solars is now implemented up through Return of the Scarlet Empress and Under the Rose.
    <ul>
      <li>
        In light of the recent errata dump, Dreams of the First Age is not currently supported, but will be released soon, including the Scroll of Errata changes.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>(Future changelogs WILL be more detailed; to help with this, please use the bug tracker!)</p>

<h2>Making Progress</h2>
<p><b>posted by Eric on 29/07/2010</b></p>
<p>Hello to everyone. Eric Astor here, a long-time Anathema user - and now one of your new developers. As Urs pointed out in his last post, Craig's time is not infinite, but the wonders of open source mean that others can contribute to the project as well. We've had it pointed out that we haven't been good about keeping the community up-to-date yet, and this is our first attempt to change that.</p>
<p>Some work had been done on a fork of Anathema before Urs handed this site over to us, and during our silence, we've been working on merging those changes into Anathema. The current plan is for the next release to include proper support for the books released to date - or, at least, as many of them as we can manage - and some significant bug fixes. For instance, we are aware of the bug that causes Armor to become unchecked on the Equipment screen after saving and reloading a character, and that bug will certainly be patched!</p>
<p>Once we finish this merge and a few patches, which should be fairly soon now, we'll post a new release of Anathema - version 1.4.1. Keep an eye out here for future updates!</p>

<h2>State of Anathema</h2>
<p><b>posted by Urs on 11/07/2010</b></p>
<p>It's been a long time. Life, work, D&D, all of these have been quite efficient at keeping us from working at anathema.
Just as you probably did 2 years ago, we have finally come to realize that this is not likely to change.</p>
<p>As such, we're leaving the project in the hands of <a href="mailto:gribble@clear.net.nz">Craig Bishell.</a> While his time is not infinite, he is motivated to keep this going - and looking for your contribution!</p>
<p>If you care for my thoughts (or have always longed for an inclusion in a public "thank you" statement by someone you don't know at all), 
<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dhph52x2_775gfm36rf9">read on</a>.
